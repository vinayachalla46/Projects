# üçï Pizza Billing System (Core Java - Internship Project)

This project is a simple and user-friendly **Pizza Billing System** developed as part of my **3rd-year summer internship**. It uses **Core Java** with a strong focus on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts like **inheritance**, **constructors**, and **access specifiers** to simulate a real-world billing scenario in a console-based format.
